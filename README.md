# Weather forecast logger
---

Simple Python app to save weather forecast to database. This app is to be used with CRON or other utilites to run it automatically.

Idea is to collect weather forecast data and save it to analyze the precision of forecasts over time.

In the current setup OpenWeatherMap provides data for 5 days, 3h intervals in each day.

This repo will contain data analysis tools in the future.

### Running
1. Clone the repo
2. Create Python virtual environment
3. Run WeatherApi with venv executable and requirements installed.
